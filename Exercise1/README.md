# Singular Matrices

Solving linear system plays a key role in many scientific application, such as engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. 

## Requirements

Write a software that determines if the following matrices are singular or not:

1. `A` is `n` x `n` squared matrix with elements from `1` to `n^2`
2. `A` is `n` x `n` squared matrix with random elements in `[0,2]`
3. `A` is `n` x `n` hilbert squared matrix
   `A[i, j] = 1 / (1 + i + j)`.
